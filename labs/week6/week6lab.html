			<h3>Week 6 Debugging Lab</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>The <sapn style="font-style:italic">throw</sapn> keyword is used to generate an error (exception).</li>
					<li>A <span style="font-style:italic">TypeError</span> is thrown when a variable references an invalid data type. A <span style="font-style:italic">ReferenceError</span> is due to a reference to a nonexistent or missing variable.</li>
					<li>I am still very much a novice, new to writing and debugging code.  My process is not that detailed, and to that end, I find myself using the debugger in the console often, checking my work as I go.</li>
					<li>Debugging has helped with my assignments, as I'm able to see which line(s) are throwing exceptions. At this point, I'm not very proficient with debugging, but I'm sure with more practice I'll find it more useful.</li>
					<li>Debugging has helped me with my coding because I learned early on that most of my errors were related to syntax. I'd try to get ahead of myself and finally I'd open the console, only to find syntax error after syntax error. I learned to slow down some, and syntax errors become fewer and fewer.  Another instance was when I was first using JavaScript, and I was implementing a side navigation drawer.  I had a hard time with it, and relied heavily on the debugging tool in the console to help my figure out what I was doing wrong.</li>
